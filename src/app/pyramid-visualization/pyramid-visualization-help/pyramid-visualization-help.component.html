<div>
  A visualization configuration has two levels:
  <ol>
    <li>Group level</li>
    <li>Layer level</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    A layer represents a pyramid you would like to display. Each layer
    must be added to a group.<br>
    When two layers are in the same group, they can be displayed at the same
    time with some transparency thanks to the "Layer composition" module.
  </p>
  <p>
    To create a new group, you must specified a unique label.
  </p>
  <p>
    To create a new layer, you must specified a unique label, a
    pyramid and the resolution of the image in pixels per meter.<br>
    The id must be unique over all the layers of the visualization
    (not just for its group).<br>
    The pixels per meter parameter will be automatically filled if it can be
    retrieved from the selected pyramid metadata.
